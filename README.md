# Fem-Labeller

## Project Overview
The Female (FEM) Labeller is a flutter based application which is a simple and user-friendly tool designed for gynecologists to label ultrasound frames efficiently. Its primary objective is to collect medically validated ultrasound data of the female reproductive system to develop AI models for detecting abnormalities. By automating the annotation process in real-time, the application saves time and generates a large, annotated dataset, facilitating the development of robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for abnormality classification in both routine and clinical settings.

The application consisted of a secure login system, profle setup, and the labeller module.

For each ultrasound frame, there are 3 questions i.e., whether the ultrasound has an abnormality or not, what label(s) can be given to the frame and lastly what all organs are visible in that frame. For each of the question, multiple options were given to the users where-in the first question was single choice while other two are multi choice.

In the first question, the two options were: `healthy` , `has an abnormality`. 
The second question had thirty four options that were `Round and Thin walled with posterior enhancement`, `Cumulus oophorous`, `Corpus luteum`, `Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst`, `Hemorrhagic corpus luteum`, `Endometrioma`, `Serous cystadenoma`, `Serous cystadenocarcinoma`, `Mucinous cystadenoma`, `Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma`, `Dermoid cyst`, `Dermoid plug`, `Rokitansky nodule`, `Dermoid mesh`, `Dot dash pattern`, `Floating balls sign`, `Ovarian fibroma`, `Ovarian thecoma`, `Metastasis`, `Para ovarian cyst`, `Polycystic ovary`, `Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome`, `Ovarian torsion`, `Thick hyperechoic margin`, `Vaginal ultrasound`, `Right ovary`, `Transvaginal ultrasound`, `Gestational sac`, `Foetus`, `Chocolate cyst`, `Cervix`, `Urinary bladder`, `Polyp`, `Cervical cyst`. In third question, four option were given namely, `Adnexa`, `Vagina`, `Ovary`, `Uterus`. Additionally, there is a fourth question where the user can input any other comment related to the frame.

In the back-end, time taken to analyse each frame is recorded and for each selection in any of questions, a numeric ‘1’ is assigned. Rest of the non-selected options were assigned a numeric ‘0’. In this manner, each ultrasound frame were assigned different labels and values for different values of total 40 options. This assignment was done by the inspiration of one-hot encoding method. It is a method used to convert categorical values to binary value of ‘0’ or ‘1’. All this data was saved in real-time in the form of an excel sheet at the application’s back-end. The sheet stores were—**(1) option selected for each of the question(multiples options for question 2 and 3), (2) any comment added by user, (3) time taken for complete analysis of frame, and (4) email ID.**


## FEM Labeller Application Manual
The **FEM Labeller Application Manual** is a comprehensive guide designed to help users understand the functionality of the FEM-Labeller app. It provides detailed instructions on how to navigate the app, use its various features, and effectively score label utrasound frames. The manual is essential for both new users and those looking to maximize the app's potential. To access the manual, please refer to the documentation included in the repository by the name of PCOS Labeller Application Manual.

## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the app on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK: [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK: Comes with Flutter
- Android Studio or Xcode: For running the app on an emulator or physical device
- Firebase account: For backend services

### Installation 
#### (run these commands in the terminal)
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/misahub2023/FEM-LABELLER.git
    ```
2. Update flutter and its dependencies: 
    ```bash
    flutter upgrade
    ``` 
3. Check whether flutter is ready for use: 
    ```bash
    flutter doctor
    ```
    Resolve any issues shown by flutter doctor before moving to next steps

4. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

### Google Sheets Setup
1. Create a project in Google Cloud and enable the Google Sheets API.
2. Download the JSON credentials file for a service account and replace the placeholders in the `credentials` field with your actual credentials in `lib/services/sheet.dart`.
3. Create a new Google Spreadsheet and share it with the service account email (client_email from the `credentials`).
4. Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL and replace the placeholder in `spreadsheetId` with your actual spreadsheet ID in `lib/services/sheet.dart`.

### Firebase Setup
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Add an Android app to your Firebase project. Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `android/app` directory. A sample of the json file is already in the directory.
3. Add an iOS app to your Firebase project. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and place it in the `ios/Runner` directory and also update `ios/firebase_app_id_file.json`. A sample of the both the files could be found in the mentioned directory.
4. Modify the `pubspec.yaml` file to include the necessary Firebase dependencies:
    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      firebase_core: latest_version
      firebase_auth: latest_version
      cloud_firestore: latest_version
    ```

### Running the App
1. Connect your device or start an emulator.
2. Run the app:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
